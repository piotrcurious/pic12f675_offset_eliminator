The comparator output is enabled on GP5 because it is used as the PWM output pin for the CCP1 module. The CCP1 module can operate in four modes: capture, compare, PWM and special event trigger. In PWM mode, the CCP1 pin is configured as an output and drives the PWM signal according to the duty cycle and frequency settings. The comparator output on GP5 is controlled by the CCP1CON register, which sets the PWM mode and the two most significant bits of the 10-bit duty cycle value. The other eight bits of the duty cycle value are stored in the CCPR1L register. The PWM frequency is determined by the Timer 2 module, which has a prescaler, a period register (PR2) and a postscaler. The PWM frequency formula is:

$$
PWM\ frequency = \frac{F_{OSC}}{(TMR2\ prescaler) \times (PR2 + 1) \times (TMR2\ postscaler)}
$$

where $F_{OSC}$ is the oscillator frequency. In this code, the oscillator frequency is set to 4 MHz, the Timer 2 prescaler is set to 4, the PR2 value is set to 249 and the Timer 2 postscaler is set to 1. Therefore, the PWM frequency is:

$$
PWM\ frequency = \frac{4\times10^6}{(4) \times (249 + 1) \times (1)} = 4\times10^3\ Hz
$$

The PWM duty cycle is determined by the CCPR1L and CCP1CON registers, which store the 10-bit duty cycle value. The PWM duty cycle formula is:

$$
PWM\ duty\ cycle = \frac{(CCPR1L:CCP1CON<5:4>)}{2^{10}} \times 100\%
$$

where CCPR1L:CCP1CON<5:4> is the concatenation of the CCPR1L register and bits 5 and 4 of the CCP1CON register. In this code, the duty cycle value is calculated from the product of the difference and the third ADC value, divided by the maximum possible duty cycle value (1023). Therefore, the duty cycle value can vary from 0 to 1023, corresponding to a duty cycle range from 0% to 100%.
