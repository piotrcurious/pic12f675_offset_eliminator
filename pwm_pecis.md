The PWM frequency in the code I have written is determined by the value of PR2 register, the CPU frequency of PIC12F675 microcontroller, and the prescaler and postscaler of timer2. According to the [PIC12F675 datasheet], the formula for calculating the PWM frequency is:

$$f_{PWM} = \frac{f_{OSC}}{(PR2 + 1) \times 4 \times prescaler \times postscaler}$$

where $f_{OSC}$ is the CPU frequency, $PR2$ is the value loaded in PR2 register, and $prescaler$ and $postscaler$ are the frequency dividers for timer2. In the code I have written, I have used a PR2 value of 0xFF, a CPU frequency of 4 MHz (using the internal oscillator), and a prescaler and postscaler of 1:1. Therefore, the PWM frequency will be:

$$f_{PWM} = \frac{4 \times 10^6}{(255 + 1) \times 4 \times 1 \times 1} = 3.9 kHz$$

This is the PWM frequency that will be generated on GP2 pin by the code I have written. To change the PWM frequency, we can either change the CPU frequency, the PR2 value, or the prescaler and postscaler values. For example, if we use a 20 MHz external crystal, a PR2 value of 0x7F, and a prescaler and postscaler of 1:16, then the PWM frequency will be:

$$f_{PWM} = \frac{20 \times 10^6}{(127 + 1) \times 4 \times 1 \times 16} = 9.8 kHz$$

This is close to the maximum PWM frequency of 10 kHz that can be achieved with PIC12F675 microcontroller.

No, PIC12F675 does not support 16-bit PWM natively. It only has one CCP module that can generate 10-bit PWM on GP2 pin¹. However, it is possible to use software techniques to generate 16-bit PWM using the timer interrupts and GPIO pins²³. This requires some programming skills and careful timing calculations. Alternatively, one can use a different PIC microcontroller that has 16-bit PWM support, such as PIC16F1789⁴.
